Car crash detection
---
#### A car accident detection system based on Arduino UNO, MPU-6050 Accelerometer + Gyro and a webcam.
These scripts primarily act as a backbone for the entire car accident detection system, detecting a crash, recording the crash video (using **cv2**), sending an alert to the relevant authorities (using **smtplib**) and ploting the results (using **matplotlib**)/
